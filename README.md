# Typing Tutor

Welcome to the Typing Tutor project! This application is designed to improve your typing skills through three different game modes: Speed Typing, Paragraph Completion, and Catch the Letter. The project is implemented in C and includes leaderboards for each game mode to track and compare your progress.
